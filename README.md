 # Array Methods Lab

## Learning Goals

- Determine if an array contains a particular element using the `include?` method
- Sort an array using the `sort` method
- Reverse the contents of an array using the `reverse` method
- Find the first and last elements in an array using the `first` and `last` methods
- Determine the size, or length, of an array using the `size` method

## Instructions

In this lab, we will be coding the solutions for each of the above tasks in the
body of a method. In `lib/array_methods.rb` we've defined a series of methods
for you, each of which is responsible for one of the tasks above. Your job is to
write the code in the body of each method to get the tests passing.

Each method takes in an argument of an array. You will call the appropriate
method, such as `include?` or `first`, on that array to get the test passing.

This lab is test-driven so run `learn` to get started and use the test output to
guide you.

Let's do the first one together:

### `using_include`

This method takes in two arguments: an array and an element. The test is
expecting the `using_include` method to return `true` if the array contains
that element and `false` if it doesn't.

We've already discussed a method that does just that: `include?`. This method is
called on an array and takes in an argument of an element. It returns `true` if
the array contains that element and `false` if it does not.

Let's get our test passing with the following code:

```ruby
# lib/array_methods.rb

def using_include(array, element)
  array.include?(element)
end
```

Run your test suite again, and you should be passing the first one.

### `using_sort`

This method takes in an argument of an array and should return the array, sorted
in ascending order. Use the `sort` method on the array to get this test
passing.

### `using_reverse`

This method takes in an argument of an array and should return the array with
the contents in reverse order. Use the `reverse` method on the array to get
this test passing.

### `using_first`

This method takes in an argument of an array and should return the first element
of that array. Try to get this test passing without using the `[]` method. Use
the `first` method instead.

### `using_last`

This method takes in an argument of an array and should return the last element
of that array. Try to get this test passing without using the `[]` method. Use
the `last` method instead.

### `using_size`

This method takes in an argument of an array and should return the size, or
length, of that array. Use the `size` method on that array to get this test
passing.
